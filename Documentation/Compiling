# Compiling

Put a user task under /tasks directory. Code what you want in general way using
provided API and any other libraries. And simply register the task by
`REGISTER_TASK(function, type, priority)`.

It generates a periodic interrupt rated by HZ for the heart rate of system.
Change HZ as you wish in `include/foundation.h`.

To access system resource, use provided API after checking how synchronization
and wait queue are handled in the right sections below.

Do not disable interrupt directly but use API.
